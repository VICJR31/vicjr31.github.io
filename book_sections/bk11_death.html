                The year is 1944. As Featherston and the Confederacy are being pushed on all fronts, the secret bomb project 
                all combatants have been trying to bear fruit: finally do. In a last hail mary, is this the CSA's final chance 
                at ultimate victory? Or complete and devastating destruction?

                    Pushing the Confederacy and Entente powers on both sides of the equator -drastic measures are taken for Jake 
                    Featherston and his country's final victory. When they finally "develop" a nuclear bomb. And with the Confederates 
                    being sliced in half, it could've been a better time for that weapon to come.

                    Striking first, despite its advantages, Featherston sends Brigadier General Clarence Potter and a Confederate spies 
                    team to smuggle in a superbomb into Philadelphia. Disguised as United States troops. And is able to detonate the nuclear 
                    warhead and incinerate part of the city. Unfortunately, though all spies, including Clarence Potter, returned from the 
                    mission, the war continues for many more months. Until the United States drops her first bomb on a radio station, Jake 
                    Featherston had just finished broadcasting from and another near Fort Sumter, in Charleston.

                <p>
                    With the coming of 1944, the C.S. Army is pushed to the point of exhaustion. With Camp Determination out west finally being 
                    captured and exposing what the Freedom Party had done to the whole world. The Confederacy eventually falls apart, with Texas 
                    seceding from the Southern States and becoming independent. And finally, Jake Featherston, the dictator behind the mic and 
                    leader of both the Freedom Party and the Confederate States of America, is killed by a black partisan. After his escaping 
                    plane crashed around Georgia, trying to take several of his aids to continue the fight further south. In the mid-summer, Vice 
                    President Don Partridge formally ends the war and surrenders to the USA. The CSA ceasing to become a country once again.

                <!--Small Explanation-->
                <p>
                    Over in Europe, late 1943, Germany in -actuality- developed the superbomb first, testing it out on Petrograd then on Paris soon 
                    after. Bringing both the Russian Empire and Monarchist France to the negotiating table. England attempted and succeeded in bombing 
                    Hamburg; however, the Germanic state retaliated by bombing London and two other English cities. Forcing the British to finally submit 
                    -especially when Japan takes over their Far East holdings and their second nuclear bomber crashes over Belgium.                   
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sadly for many U.S. servicemen, the occupying and reintegration of the Confederacy into the Union is out of the question. Though Featherston 
                    is dead. Many Freedom Party groups and Confederate diehards make initial occupation beyond difficult. The bombing, bushwhacking, and killing 
                    of many green-gray soldiers. Reprisals and shooting of Confederate hostages worsen to the point that people-bombing becomes the norm. Even 
                    with negro soldiers (whoever was left from the extermination camps) to hold the country down. Becoming a bloodbath and an uncertain future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this point in time, it's challenging to say what goes on from here. Whether it be how the United States can honestly sit on the former Confederate 
                    States till the end of time or somehow end all this carnage. Or if they and the German Empire can prevent other world powers -like Japan- from obtaining 
                    a superbomb themselves. However, if there's one thing that's sure: the world itself is in a darker place than it was before the war...Go figure?

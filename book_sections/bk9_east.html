                After a near decisive thrust into the North and cutting her off from west to east through Ohio 
                (even after U.S. President Al Smith was killed) -the United States still refuses to surrender. And, with repeated 
                failed attempts to take Richmond, the Confederate President, Jake Featherston, orders a second 
                mechanized offensive into the USA's manufacturing heartland. An offensive that will lay everything 
                on the line for both American countries, out east!

                <p>
                    From 1941-42 on the mountains and rough terrain of Northern Virginia, US drives, led by General 
                    Daniel MacArthur, smashes its face against the stonewall defenses of the Confederacy. Costing 
                    the US tons of equipment, soldiers, barrels, and many aircraft over the Rappahannock. Though 
                    other U.S. Offensives into Utah's rebellious state do see steady progress towards the capital, 
                    Salt Lake City. But with terrible losses as the Mormon defenders fight with unfathomable zeal. 
                    Many begin attaching explosives to themselves. Blowing them and anyone around them up sky high. 
                    "People bombs," witnesses call them.

                <!--Small Explanation-->
                <p>
                    Still having to worry about the British and Japanese (mostly the Japanese) out in the Pacific after Midway island is captured by the Asian country. Sinking 
                    the pride of the U.S. Navy, the <em>Remembrance</em>. And possibly threatening the Sandwich Islands through a tug-of-war type action. The C.S. Army on the 
                    mainland -watching Northern forces stall on their way to Richmond- steadily build-up in Ohio. And to crush the Yankee's spirit, Jake Featherston launches 
                    a second offensive, dubbed Operation Coalscuttle. Aiming directly into the United States' industrial state of Pennsylvania -specifically the steelmaking 
                    city of Pittsburgh.                                      
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carving deeper and deeper in the U.S. Army and its country's defenses. Victory looked to be on the C.S.A.'s horizon and grant the still short triumph Jake 
                    Featherston promised his government would achieve. However, by the fall of 1942, Pittsburgh, under the direct command of US Brigadier General Irving Morrell, 
                    had his men dig into its bombed-out ruins. Making the Confederates under Patton fight house-by-house to take the city and paying a heavy price along the way.

                    With extensive talk of the Mormon Uprising collapsing and Japan ceasing hostilities, temporarily with the USA -the island nation's eyes prying on the British 
                    Empire's colonies. Featherston, refusing to pull out the Army of Kentucky, pays the ultimate price by 1943. Forcing many Confederate troops to fight inside the 
                    city, leaving its flanks guarded by Mexican soldiers in bright yellow mustard uniforms in the snow with inadequate antibarrel equipment. And with winter barely 
                    howling, Operation Rosebud is acted out by Morrell. And US forces attack from Indiana and West Virginia. Trapping the once-mighty Confederate army inside the 
                    ruin steel city.                  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chief of the Confederate General Staff, Nathan Bedford Forest III, warns President Featherston to break out of Pittsburgh. The Confederate leader refuses and is 
                    assured by the Air Force to resupply the trapped army. However after the close-quarter, savage fighting continues. Ammo, food, and medical supplies run thin. And 
                    with General Morrell pushing further south. The realization of defeat sets in. Jake forcefully orders General Patton airlifted out of the city, while the last pockets 
                    of Confederate resistance fight to the last bullet. Until the final surrender of all remaining C.S. forces inside Pittsburgh by early February 1943. Ending in a stunning 
                    US success. And a terrible defeat for the Confederacy.

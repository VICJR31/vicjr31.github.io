                Jake Featherston, after successfully taking control of the CSA and installing the 
                Freedom Party to power above all else. Looks to improve relations with his northern 
                neighbor. To get their issues settled, he slowly builds up his country for another 
                war with the United States. And while his allies to do the same, he starts by taking 
                out some "loose ends" still lingering around and thumping their noses where they don't 
                belong in and out of his party.

                <p>
                    After officially being inaugurated into office of the C.S.A., Jake Featherston and 
                    his Freedom Party begin preparations setting the country down the path of a 
                    self-dependant, industrial and mechanized nation. Cutting off his oppositions' numbers, 
                    mainly from the Whig and Radical Liberal parties and even those within his own party. 
                    Creating many damns and shifting more agricultural focus on the use of tractors and 
                    harvesters. Throwing many black field hands, or sharecroppers, out of work and into 
                    the cities. Increasing productivity and output. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    All steps to prepare the Confederate States for its rematch against the United States 
                    for another round. By training her factories to soon produce barrels, munitions, planes, 
                    and other wartime goods when the time came. After the Great War -namely Houston and Kentucky- 
                    the states taken by the U.S.- demand to return to its rightful country. Texas's former west 
                    chunk soon becomes a battleground, similar to the Mormons and Canadians, between the U.S. 
                    Army and the Houstonians.

                    More and more former sharecroppers begin to migrate into the cities to continue to work. Several 
                    black-owned businesses are forced into paying to essentially rent their right to open shop against 
                    Freedom Party stalwarts. Seeing the writing on the walls for them, many more blacks began to openly 
                    fight the Freedom Party as Featherston soon installs himself as President for life.

                    Provoking a violent response from not only the C.S.A.'s negro population. But from his own vice President, 
                    Willy Knight, who attempts and fails in assassinating Featherston with several turned Freedom Party guards. 
                    Forcing Knight to resign and sent to a political concentration camp for treason. Giving Jake the precedent 
                    to "temporarily" increase the Confederate army in order to put down these uprisings. Something recent 
                    United States President, Al Smith, tentatively agrees on. Capturing the Confederacy's first batch of rebels 
                    and sending them to transit camps...so they are called for now.

                    In the early 40s, President Al Smith, in a bid to get re-elected and maintain peace, agrees to a referendum. 
                    Allowing the ex-Confederate states of Houston, Kentucky, and Sequoyah to vote to remain or leave the Union. 
                    So long as the C.S. president swears to no more land grabs and no soldiers on the possible returning territories. 
                    Then, after January 7, 1941, with Kentucky and Houston being two out of the three states returning to the CSA. 
                    Featherston orders in the reformed and deadly trotting new C.S. Army into the returning states -disregarding the 
                    agreement. Jake then demands back every piece of land taken by the Yankees during the Great War. Al Smith, 
                    resentfully recognizing Featherston, will not rest on this issue: refuses. Ordering to begin the quick mobilization 
                    for a possible war between the Confederate States.

                    With 1941 moving near the muggy summers of the year, news arrives from across the ocean. Informing the world of German 
                    Kaiser Wilhelm II's demise. Followed up by Britain and France, whose own governments were voted out (more or less) by 
                    their own radical regimes, demand what lands lost during the war. The new Germanic emperor refuses, as the Silver Shirt-led 
                    island nation and the now monarchist France declare war on Germany. Russia entering as well, against Austria and other 
                    Central Power forces in the East. And on June 22, while also planning out his own attack, Jake Featherston makes a phone call. 
                    Delivering the code word: "Blackbeard." Beginning and launching the invasion of Ohio and the start of the fourth war between 
                    the American states.

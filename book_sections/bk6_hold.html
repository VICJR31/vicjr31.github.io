                The decade following the end of the Great War brought a dramatic change in power. 
                And those aiming to regain their former glory of the past. Yet, when the Stock 
                Market crashes, due to Russia being unable to repay Austro-Hungarian banks from 
                the war, it sends the world into a profound depression. As a dying radical 
                right-wing party, the Freedom Party gains moment at an astonishing scale. With 
                their leader, Jake Featherston, steering to do <em>more</em> than bring the 
                Confederate States off its knees.

                    The Great Depression, caused by the economic 'bubble' built over the 1920s 
                    until finally bursting, throws many world leaders and their countries down 
                    an uncertain, downward spiral. Scrambling to try and maintain the panic. 
                    U.S. President Blackford, elected in 1928 (a year before the crash), is 
                    blamed heavily. As he tries and fails to set-up programs that prove costly 
                    and ineffective. With makeshift homes built by the homeless sardonically 
                    calling them "Blackfordburghs." Costing Blackford his bid for reelection 
                    in 1933 to Calvin Coolidge (later Herbert Hoover after Coolidge, allegedly, 
                    killed himself in his bathtub). Putting a final nail to his coffin when the 
                    Empire of Japan launched an undetected air raid on Los Angles during a small 
                    rally Blackford held.

                    Despite the war starting in 1932 between the United States and Japan, the former 
                    spotted a Japanese supply ship sending arms to Canadian rebels. Japan nearly getting 
                    in the first lick when their submarine tried and failed to sink the <em> USS Remembrance </em>. 
                    Sparking a war between the two growing powers. Dragging on until the start of Hoover's term 
                    around 1934. While both sides agree to a return to the <em>status quo</em>, for now. And the 
                    U.S. able to somewhat begin rearming its forces.

                    However, with the Confederates States hit harder more than ever from this panic. Groups like the 
                    Freedom Party had already begun flexing its muscles in secret by staying afloat. And sending volunteers 
                    down in Mexico from its Civil War back in the 20s (with some testing out the new armored barrels to help 
                    monarchist forces prevail). With more and more Confederates turning to extremism as C.S. President Burton 
                    Mitchel, like his U.S. counterparts, falls flat to provide adequate aid.

                    Soon the once-dominant party in the Confederate States, the Whig party, collapses alongside the Radical Liberals. 
                    Many of their followers, and other militant groups such as the Tin Hats and the Redemption League, absorbed by the 
                    Freedom Party. Leaving the streets and cities, more promptly in Richmond, to be light up with thousands of torches. 
                    And the thousands and thousands of Confederate battle flags' reverse colors waving proudly. With massive crowds 
                    yelling "Freedom!" as they prowled on their marches. Many intimidating, attacking, and, sometimes, killing black 
                    Confederates and those that distaste the party with unrelenting discrimination. But this only becomes the beginning.

                    Finally, following the election of 1933, Jake Featherston, leader of the Freedom Party, after a failed grab for power 
                    back in the 20s and an even bleaker one for the six years after the Calkins incident. Stands on the Gray House's podium, 
                    the equivalent to the US White House, to be inaugurated as the 13th President of the Confederate States of America. Intending 
                    to place those who wrong him and his country, <em>Over Open Sights </em>.

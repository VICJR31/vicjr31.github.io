                With a Central Power victory -and thus a United States one- the victors install harsh treaties on their beaten-down enemies 
                with the CSA being no exception. Having much of her land taken away and forced to pay reparations, while having inflation 
                never before seen. Radical elements begin to take shape in Confederate politics. Bringing forth something terrible in the 
                near future.

                    by the CSA and her allies. Where the Stars and Stripes flew upsidedown. After decades of preparation, rationing, building, 
                    and learning from her German brothers: the massive parades across the United States celebrate with jubilee. After their victory 
                    in the Great War and stuffing themselves with the lands conquered in Canada, several British islands, and chunks of the Confederacy.

                    between the USA and the CSA. Along with, as Theodore Roosevelt put, "Having The U.S. a place under the sun." Many inside the U.S. 
                    start to refer to the country as the "American Empire." Despite the unrest of available jobs and liberties in this new United States.

                    Yet, in the Confederate States, everything was destroyed and possibly broken beyond repair. Richmond was a beaten city with hundreds, 
                    if not thousands, of former butternut Confederate soldiers taking refuge on the streets, by statues, or anywhere that provided some 
                    shelter or space. Add on an already battered economy where inflation sky-rocketed the price of the C.S. bill (dollar in the U.S.) in 
                    the hundreds, and necessary expenses like bread cost a whole paycheck. And with work being hard to find and being far in-between. New 
                    radical parties take hold. Promising renewed strength and stability. One of these brand-new parties, the Freedom Party, led by an 
                    ex-artillery sergeant by the name of Jake Featherston, voicing their racial rhetoric of being "stabbed in the back" by their blacks.

                    During the 1920s, the Freedom Party, consisting of many former C.S. Army veterans dress in white shirts and butternut trousers, rein 
                    in an efficient tactic of quelling the opposition. Fighting and breaking up other party rallies, the Whigs and Radical Liberals mostly, 
                    to align the Confederate citizens to their side through mostly intimidation. Nearly winning Featherston a chance at the Presidency in 1921. But, 
                    after Whig president Wade Hampton V is assassinated by a Freedom Party stalwart, Grady Calkins. And, despite pleads of the party not actively  
                    being involved with the incident, start to catch the heat and lose popularity. Especially more so when vice president Burton Mitchel asks 
                    the U.S. Socialist President Upton Sinclair to dissolve the reparations place on the C.S.A. to better its shambled economy; the Northern 
                    President agrees. Sending the party back a notch...for now.                
                </p>
                    In the United States, costs of new weapon improvements, like barrels and aircraft carriers, reduce immensely now that victory was achieved. Despite 
                    the obvious trouble boiling down south of the border. Only temporarily do events calm down a bit with the Confederate economy finally recovering and 
                    support for the Freedom Party diminished. As other extremist groups worldwide, such as the Silver Shirts in Britain lead by Mosley and Winston Churchill, 
                    and the <em>Action Francaise</em> in France. Then the world is plunged into utter chaos in 1929. As debts owed to Austria-Hungary are unpaid by Russia. 
                    Crashing the Stock Market. Giving these groups, Featherston and his Freedom Party primarily, the fuel to rise and thrive.

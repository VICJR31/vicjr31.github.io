                1941. Jake Featherston launches Operation Blackbeard, the invasion of Ohio, to cut the United 
                States in half and kicked them between the teeth in a war of lighting speed and tactics. The 
                USA struggles to hold back the Confederate advance and her territories acquired in Utah, Canada, 
                and in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans from other Entente forces. Kicking off this new, deadly 
                type of war.

                    All around the globe, former and new players from the last war either became neutral or joined the side they were 
                    on from the Great War. The Empire of Japan being one of them. And eager to continue what she left off with the USA 
                    during the Pacific War back in the 30s. While the former state of Utah, and to an extent initially, Canada, begin 
                    another uprising costing several U.S. divisions to be sent to squash the rebellions. Giving Featherston's men a 
                    more favorable time out east. While in Europe, Germany loses Belgium, and Holland turning into a slugging match. 
                    Dealing with also the Russian Empire out east alongside Austria-Hungary. With the duel-monarchy fighting her own 
                    Serbian, Croatian, and other Balkan ethnic groups inside her own borders. Shortly losing Ukraine to the giant 
                    Slavic state.

                    Taking advantage of this starting setback and lack of proper preparation, Featherston's fighting forces race and 
                    whacked through U.S. lines like a hot knife through butter. Implementing a severe doctrine of combined arms warfare 
                    with her primary focus on bombing the enemy with planes and artillery then smashing through with barrels and lots of 
                    them. Making way for their butternut infantrymen to fill in the gaps and spray any US green-gray soldiers with superior 
                    firepower. As the United States still used bolt-action Springfield rifles, while the South outfitted their troops with 
                    submachine guns and automatic rifles to match.

                <p>
                    As Confederate General George Patton smashes deep enough into Northern forces, Ohio's capital is finally encircled and falls. Leaving Brigadier General Abner Dowling scrambling to set up proper defenses 
                    and can do -at best- is delay the Confederates the inevitable. Worse still, U.S. barrel commander Irving Morrell's counterattacks on the CSA's flanks are repelled due to lack of armor and other material 
                    to be effective. And in the summer's near end, August 1941, the city of Sandusky surrenders. Bringing the Confederate Army of Kentucky to its final goal: reaching Lake Erie's shores and cutting the United 
                    States of America in half.                 
                </p>

                    Jake Featherston then offers peace terms to the United States. Swearing to return, all Yankee lands conquered during the invasion of Ohio. So long as Al Smith gives back all territory taken from the Great 
                    War and dismantle all fortifications that border the Mason-Dixie land -excluding Washington D.C. And to pay back reparations and allow Confederate inspectors into the USA to ensure orders are conveyed. 
                    Much to Confederate President's reluctant bemusement, President Al Smith refuses and urges the country to fight on. However, during a Confederate night raid on Philadelphia, Smith is killed in the Presidential Residence 
                    from a direct hit while taking shelter. The next morning, being succeeded by Vice President Charles W. La Follette -urging the country forward and to never surrender.

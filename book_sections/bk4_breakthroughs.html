                As the Great War enters its third and bloodiest year across a front stretching from Virginia's shores, all the 
                way down near the Pacific over North America. New innovations and battle strategies are initiated to break the 
                deadlock between the United States and the Confederacy. And with the production of new weapons, known as barrels, 
                coming to the chessboard. A way to end the war, favorable, comes to light.

                    Entering the end of 1916 and onwards toward 1917.  The war for the Entente Powers, 
                    more specifically for the Confederate States, has lost its power. As the Central 
                    Powers are slowly -and costly- advancing on most fronts. With the CSA's bruises 
                    and fatigue beginning to show against the USA and from its many black rebellions 
                    back home being put down. As parts of West Texas conquered by the north, forming 
                    the rascal state of Houston. Including the states of Sequoyah and Kentucky, all 
                    but annexed. France and Russia are looking ever more to calling for peace 
                    negotiations
                </p>

                <p>
                    Still, the war, while bleak for the Confederates, doesn't mean the U.S. Army isn't 
                    paying a pretty penny for her advances. Despite having more material and more barrels 
                    -while simultaneously still fighting the Canadians and British up north of them. The 
                    fighting all around continuing to remain a bloody and destructive affair with no real 
                    end in sight. However, on the 35th Remembrance Day anniversary, a day morning and 
                    contempt for her loss in the Second Mexican War by the CSA and her Allies. A massive 
                    armored spearhead, under the command of General George Armstrong Custer, launches a 
                    devastating attack on the borders of Tennessee. A secret plan under the noses of the 
                    U.S. General Staff dubbed the Barrel Roll Offensive. Co-lead by a bright, eager officer, 
                    Irving Morrell, and Custer's adjutant, Abner Dowling. Successfully breaking the Mason-Dixie line. 
                    Throwing both colored and white Confederate troops mile after mile from the entire front

                   Smashing unchallenged into Nashville. News arrives of the capitulation of France and
                   Russia. Leaving the British alongside the C.S.A. to seriously fight on. 
                   Despite the intense vigor, her province of Canada begins to fill the same winds inflicted 
                   on her Confederate ally. As the country starts to finally collapse and surrender, with Quebec 
                   gaining independence of it. And with the entry of the Empire of Brazil on the Central Powers' 
                   side -efficiently cutting off Britain's meat and wheat supplies from Argentina- the island soon throws in the towel.
                   And with the C.S. Army in shambles. They, too, agree to a cease-fire after Chattanooga falls. Ending the 
                   Great War in September 1917.

                    As the Central Powers rein victory in both the American and European 
                    theaters of war. Most of eastern Europe is put under the direct control of 
                    Austria and the German Empire. With the latter soon annexing the rest of 
                    Alsace-Lorraine from France and the Belgium Congo. As Austria-Hungary holds 
                    Albania and Serbia under their influence and the Ottoman Empire remaining stable 
                    in their territories.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In North America, Britain loses the entirety of Canada, Newfoundland, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the upper 
                    part of Maine lost during the Second Mexican War to the United States. As the Confederacy loses most of West Texas, all of Sequoyah, 
                    a chunk of Sonora, and Kentucky. And most of Northern Virginia annexed into West Virginia. All of this, including 
                    heavy reparations, placed on the losing side. And with the Confederate States in shambles and her biggest longtime 
                    rival sitting on her (metaphorically and to an extent, quite literally). The seeds of hatred and bitterness arise. 
                    Will this truly be a "peace" that lasts?

                On September 9, 1862, an order dubbed by General Robert E. Lee 
                as Special Order 191, written and wrapped into some cigars, was 
                dropped during an advance by Confederate forces. However, it is 
                quickly recovered and, instead of the Bloodiest Day in American 
                history occurring, Antietam. Lee catches the Army of the Potomac, 
                led by McClellan, entirely off guard at Camp Hill. Defeat him, and 
                move towards Philadelphia. Occupying it...

                    In our timeline, C.S. General Lee's plan, Order 191, split up his forces to better take the Union Army under General 
                    McClellan off guard. One of these orders, as mentioned before, was dropped by a Confederate soldier and found by Union Forces 
                    -working its way up the chain of command until it reached McClellan himself. Forcing a battle at Antietam and setting the rest of 
                    the Civil War as we know it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the orders are entirely recovered by two Confederate infantrymen. The plan is carried out under the United States' noses. 
                    And the fateful battle at Camp Hill spells doom for the possible reunification of the two countries altogether. Ending in a Confederate 
                    victory, that leads to the occupation of Philadelphia. Making Britain and France, who were keeping a wary eye on the war in North America, 
                    to recognize the Confederate States. And, under tremendous pressure by the two powerful European empires and the war in shambles, 
                    U.S. President Lincoln is forced to negotiate peace.

                <p>
                    Close to twenty years after the end of the 'War of Secession,' another comes over the two states' horizon. When the CSA wishes to purchase 
                    Chihuahua and Sonora from the Empire of Mexico since the latter is in debt. The United States, under President James G. Blaine, threatens 
                    war if the purchase is processed. Fearing for a second coming to their sovereignty, the Confederate States  get the blessing of her two allies, 
                    France and Britain, to intervene if the Union attacks -so long as the C.S.A. frees its slaves. Seeing no other choice, they agree and proceed to 
                    annex the two former Mexican States. Causing the USA to declare war, starting the Second Mexican War.

                <!--Small Explanation-->
                <p>
                    From June 25, 1881, until April 22, 1882, the second conflict between the two rival American states was fought. Twice, since the CSA was formed, 
                    she defeats her northern counterpart, with the two former-Mexican states being sworn into the Confederacy. After winning the war, the US loses its 
                    northern part of Maine to Canada. The state of Utah, due to trying to pull what the Confederates did two decades earlier, have their leaders hanged 
                    and made an example of, making the Mormons to call for independence further down the road. Even a victory against Canadian Forces up in Montana 
                    by a band of soldiers led by Theodore Roosevelt and United States Army officer George Armstrong Custer isn't enough to turn the tides of the war.

                    Humiliated and beaten a second time by a country that was brand new. The United States of America seeks new allies herself. Otto Von Bismarck, chancellor of the newly created 
                    German Empire is quick to seek an alliance with the sizeable resource-rich north. And, using her failures and defeats as motivation -as Remembrance- the United 
                    States agrees to German proposals. Preparing for another war with the Confederate States in the future.

                        After a near decisive thrust into the North and cutting her off from west to east through Ohio 
                        (even after U.S. President Al Smith was killed) -the United States still refuses to surrender. And, with repeated 
                        failed attempts to take Richmond, the Confederate President, Jake Featherston, orders a second 
                        mechanized offensive into the USA's manufacturing heartland. An offensive that will lay everything 
                        on the line for both American countries, out east!
